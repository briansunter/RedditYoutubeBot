Reddit YouTube Playlist Bot
---

This app takes the top videos on Reddit of the day and turns them into a YouTube playlist.
Instead of clicking links on Reddit, just go to the YouTube playlist for that day and watch them all at once.
This makes watching videos way easier on Chromecast and mobile.

###Check out the playlist here!
